<p>During the development of this app, I learned how to use SDK (Software Development Kit) tools and fetch data after the user logs into my app using Facebook Login.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the app requires advanced settings to work for every user other than the dev team, but still, the code is correct and functional.</p>
